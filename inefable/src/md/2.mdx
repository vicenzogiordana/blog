Emptiness filled my room; you could see it in the middle of chaos.  

The piles of clothes could tell you a story, if only they had mouths to speak, for they have been silenced and it feels an eternity since they have been out of their place. Probably have already forgotten what was like to be tight up, without the gilt they carry in the fibers of every tissue thrown at the floor, taken away their meaning, pretending they have no worth.  

Once white walls are now painted with mud and spider webs hang in the ceiling, decorating the room in a spirit of Christmas.  

The cleaning lady is nowhere to be seen. I might have forgotten the way she looked like.  
She promised she would come back… Was it tomorrow?  

Through the windows, a murmur of long nights of bad sleep left,  
Traveling across other rooms, hoping for another open window to slide in.  
But the ego talks lauder than any other cry for help, even at its quietest.  

The door is decorated with flowers of many kinds.  
There’s even a rug written ‘Welcome’.  
Only a fool would fall for it. For my luck, there’s a bunch of them.  
Such a lovely home.  

Curiosity filled their souls. Oh, imagine how beautiful it could be!  
The door is looked with seven chains. Nobody has ever seen inside.  

There was a nock last night.  
“Yes, hello”.  
It was the neighbor.  
“I heard a cry for help, your window told me”.  
“The TV broke, she’s just a bit dramatic. Don’t worry”.  

There she was, that big smile that had everybody dulled.  
“Can I help you fix it?”  
“It’s already fixed, I already fixed it. I always do”.  
I always did.  

If only my window and door could agree on something, wouldn’t have everyone confused.  
Maybe the piles of clothes would go back to its place and the cleaning lady would remember her promise and come back. Maybe the chains would break and the emptiness, move out.  

It was embarrassing, almost. To feel something and be the whole opposite.  

One day as I was leaving my room to go to work, I looked at all the other rooms.  
Some had similar decorations, others didn’t care as much, most of them would make a big of a deal about how their doors looked.  
But all of them had chains. Every door was looked.  
Everyone was an empty mess pretending to be whole.
