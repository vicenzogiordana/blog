You deserve the romance novel.  

You deserve the kind of love that brings peace and not butterflies.  
You deserve the kind of love that gives life to the dead.  
You deserve the kind of love that takes away the pain.  
You deserve the kind of love that loves every inch of your soul and not only body.  

You deserve the kind of love that counts the hours to see you.  
You deserve the kind of love that is not ashamed to love you.  
You deserve the kind of love that is seen in a bouquet of flowers every week.  
You deserve the kind of love that words fail to tell.  

You deserve the kind of love that would fight for you.  
You deserve the kind of love that is a shoulder to cry on.  
The kind of love that makes you laugh.  
The kind of love that feels like home.  

The kind of love that calls at 3p.m. to tell you how much he loves you,  
and not at 3a.m. when no one is around.  
The kind of love that screams at the top of his lungs that you are his,  
and he is yours.  
The kind of love that writes love letters for you every night.  

A delusional kind of love.  
An unrealistic kind of love.  
A frustrating kind of love.  
A love that doesn't exist anymore.  

A love that women write so it's easier to live.  
A love that women write so maybe someone can see,  
and not just read,  
and follow step by step to have her.  

A love that women write as a form of self-comfort.  
As pity.  
Because we know that the love of books and movies  
will stay in words and screens.  

For us to see and hope.  
For us to daydream.  
For us to look like lunatics.  

You deserve the kind of love that seems impossible.  

A woman like you  
Deserves to be loved  
The way  
We look at the moon.
