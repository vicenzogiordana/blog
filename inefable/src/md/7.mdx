There’s passion where love cannot be seen,  
For passion holds the body, and love, the soul.  

The body is easier to look and touch, to get attracted.  
The soul, on the other hand, is hard to see and hear, to be attached.  

It is easier to leave when there’s only passion,  
a body as familiar as that can be found  
at any corner  
in a different continent  
in a completely unknown timeline.  

But once you have found love,  
it takes everything in you to leave,  
for that soul is only one in the universe  
and in all centuries,  
there’ll never be a soul slightly equivalent  
for you to know.  

Passion is selfish for it is empty.  
Never fully loaded, always half the danger.  

Love is absolute  
and its only ‘desire’ is to give  
so the soul feels complete;  
be the last piece of the puzzle  
only love can fulfill.  
It’s a hole of danger,  
for it is selfless  
and easy to take advantage of.  

Passion controls your heart,  
and your body reacts  
when her figure enters the scene.  

Love owns your mind,  
for it is not a feeling  
but a cause  
that leads the decision  
of sharing your home.  

It is indeed a mystery  
how humans find more value in passion than love.  
They choose the infrequent over the permanent,  
for it is preferable to have fun  
than to be vulnerable.  

And as love fades so does respect,  
and the passion for power is praised.  
And the seasons pass by,  
and the heart becomes stone.  

Leaving us with plenty of empties  
“I love you”.
