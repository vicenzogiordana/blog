They were more than friends.  

She wrote poems for him,  
And he told her his every move.  

She listened carefully,  
And he made her laugh fully.  

She was wise and cold,  
He was impulsive and warm.  

Her smile was breathtaking,  
And his words, truly charming.  

She was hurting inside,  
And he was an amazing liar.  

They would talk for hours,  
If only distance wasn't a matter.  

But when distance was out of the game,  
No words were exchanged.  

Strangers.  
Less than friends.  

Since the day they met,  
They were meant to fall for each other.  

Unfortunately,  
They were not meant to have one another.  

To feel it,  
Not to be it.  

Yet,  
She loved him.  

And he,  
Well, he... Let's just say he tried his best.  

He knew he couldn't love her the way she loved him.  
Not in the way she deserved.  

At the end of the day,  
They were more than friends,  
But less than lovers.
